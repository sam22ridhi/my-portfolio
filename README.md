# **Retro Desktop Portfolio - A Windows XP Vibe**

Welcome to my **Retro Desktop Portfolio**, an indie-inspired, cool, and aesthetic website that mimics the iconic Windows XP interface. This interactive website uses a nostalgic desktop experience, where each folder icon reveals a content window—just like the old days!

## **Overview**
This project brings the nostalgic feel of an XP desktop straight to your browser. Using React and modern web technologies, I’ve created an engaging experience where icons like **About Me** and **Skills** open up as interactive pop-up windows, reminiscent of the early 2000s desktop environments.

## **Features**
- **Retro Desktop Theme:** A Windows XP-style background, complete with pixelated icons and folder animations.
- **Interactive Pop-ups:** Clickable icons that open sleek, animated windows displaying content.
- **Smooth Hover Effects:** Folder icons that grow and change opacity when hovered, adding a touch of interactivity.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all screen sizes, with smooth scaling for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Custom Background:** A personalized background to set the perfect tone for your portfolio.
- **Text and Content Areas:** Content like **About Me**, **Skills**, and more is displayed in retro windows that pop up, styled in a clean, simple way.

## **Tech Stack**
- **React**: The power behind this interactive, component-based app.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, with flexbox, animations, and custom hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, content display, and dynamic effects.
- **Custom Fonts**: Using the **Courier New** font for that nostalgic, retro feel.
- **Flexbox Layout**: For smooth, responsive layouts and alignment of the icons.
